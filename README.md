#### Declarative Matrix Language

This is my first attempt at creating my own language using [bnfc](http://bnfc.digitalgrammars.com).

Although the language is about matrices, the computational efficiency of matrices was not the main focus (dml can only manipulate 2D matricies anyways).

See the pdfs in this repository for documentation on the language specification, or check out the demos. The makefile uses the command `bnfc` and `pdflatex`, so you will need to install those binaries and put them in your `PATH` enviroment variable if you plan on using them.

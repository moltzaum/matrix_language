#### Declarative Matrix Language

This is my first attempt at creating my own language using [bnfc](http://bnfc.digitalgrammars.com).

See the pdfs in this repository for documentation on the language specification, or check out the demos. The makefile uses the command `bnfc` and `pdflatex`, so you will need to install those binaries and put them in your `PATH` enviroment variable if you plan on using them.

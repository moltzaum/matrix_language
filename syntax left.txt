//Dimension and column space:
dim (A)
Null (A)
Row (A)
Col (A)

//Matrix Matrix Rules:
Dot Product      A * B		same size matrix
Cross Product    A x B		b == c for: [a][b] x [c][d]
Addition         A + B		same size matrix
Subtraction      A - B		same size matrix

//Other Matrix Functions:
Transpose         A^T
Inverse           A^-1
Determinant       det(A)
